/*
  	A South African ID number is a 13-digit number which is defined by the following format: YYMMDDSSSSCAZ.
		- The first 6 digits (YYMMDD) are based on your date of birth. 20 February 1992 is displayed as 920220.
		- The next 4 digits (SSSS) are used to define your gender.  Females are assigned numbers in the range 0000-4999 and males from 5000-9999.
		- The next digit (C) shows if you're an SA citizen status with 0 denoting that you were born a SA citizen and 1 denoting that you're a permanent resident.
		- The last digit (Z) is a checksum digit â€“ used to check that the number sequence is accurate using a set formula called the Luhn algorithm.
		- The graphic below details the different sections of an ID number, based on the fictitious sequence 9202204720082
    
  Format:
	{YYMMDD}{G}{SSS}{C}{A}{Z}
	YYMMDD : Date of birth.
	G  : Gender. 0-4 Female; 5-9 Male.
	SSS  : Sequence No. for DOB/G combination.
	C  : Citizenship. 0 SA; 1 Other.
	A  : Usually 8, or 9 [can be other values]
	Z  : Control digit calculated in the following section:
